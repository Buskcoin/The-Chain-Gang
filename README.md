# The-Chain-Gang
Use counterparty tokens as placeholders in order to enable multiple issuers.

###Joining The Chain Gang (warning: this will cost 0.5 XCP)
Note: these instructions assume you know how to use counterwallet.io. 

1. In order to join The Chain Gang **you first must know what the current official token is**. For the sake of ease, weâ€™ll call it **FOOBAR**. You can find the current token by running the php locally or by simply going to www.hodl.info and checking where it says Official Token at the bottom.

2. Create an **alphabet asset**. The alphabet asset can be maximum of 6 characters long. You must issue an amount more than the **FOOBAR** in circulation. You can issue a maximum of 5000 additional tokens to distribute to yourself or however you please. You must issue at least 50 extra tokens.


3. Create a **numeric asset** (e.g. A954280000000012345678). The numeric asset can be a **maximum** of 20 numbers long ("A" followed by 20 numbers). The issuance must match the issuance of your alphabet asset.

4. Send both assets to all holders of the **FOOBAR** and keep 5000 of each for yourself.

5. **Lock both assets**

After these steps are complete the asset will be shown as a viable asset for anyone who runs the PHP or goes to www.hodl.info and they will vote for you if they want. If you win the majority vote your asset will become the new official asset, replacing **FOOBAR**, and be forever linked in the token chain.

The numeric asset issued will be used as the next vote token.
