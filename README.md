 In order to join the chain gang **you must first know what the current Asset is**. You can find this by running the program. You then: 

* create an **alphabet asset**. The alphabet asset **must** be 6 characters long. You are allowed to issue 50 additional to distribute to yourself or however you please. 

* create a **numeric asset** A95428xxxxxxxxxxxxx. The numeric asset **must** be 19 characters long("A" followed by 18 numbers). 
equal to the amount of the current Chain Gang Asset in circulation. You are allowed to issue 50 additional to distribute to yourself or however you please.

* Send both assets to all holders of The Chain Gang Token you found above and keep 50 of each for yourself.

* **Lock both assets**

After these steps are complete the asset will be shown as a viable assets for anyone who runs the program and they will vote for you if they want. If you win the majority vote your asset will become theofficial asset and be forever linked in the token chain
